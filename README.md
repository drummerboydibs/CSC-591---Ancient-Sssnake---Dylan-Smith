# Ancient-Sssnake
 ## Dylan Smith's submission for University of Michigan-Flint's 2023 Game Jam for course CSC 591
For the fall 2023 semester, we had just over 2 weeks to make a game. At this time, this is the most complex thing I've designed or coded.

**How to Play**
- Move with WASD.
- Jump with Spacebar.
- Interact with E.
- Attack with left mouse click.

**Cryptic Hints**
- Pleae with speakers or headphones on.
- Time flies when you're with friends.
- Older snakes are stronger.
- Everything's easier with friends.
